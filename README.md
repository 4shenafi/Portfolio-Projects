# Portfolio Projects

Welcome to the **Portfolio Projects** repository! 🎉

This repository showcases a collection of my personal and academic projects, each reflecting my journey and growth in software development. Here, you'll find various projects demonstrating my skills in backend development, Python programming, and other technologies.
